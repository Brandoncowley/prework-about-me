      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am brand new to software development and coding. Welcome to my first live hosted page!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Boston, MA, born and raised</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I consume YouTube on a professional level, I enjoy making art, working out, and traveling to new cities and countries.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Professional racing driver, educator, movie director, or upscale hotel reviewer. My dreams are diverse...</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently based in Los Angeles, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Technology, and specifically having a web/mobile presence, will inevitably be mandatory for businesses of the future. Being able to help them deliver a high-quality representation of themselves and their brand online seems like it will be a "forever skill" of sorts, and in my pursuit to be useful and valuable, I think this is a great field to position myself within.</p>
